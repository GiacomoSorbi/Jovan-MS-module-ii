			<p>
				I am a London based photographer specialising in Architecture
				Photography.
			</p>

			<p>
				Originally from another city, I studied architecture and photography at
				the University of the Architecture and Photography at another city. Iâ€™ve
				spent my early career working for several architectural practices around
				the world as an architectural assistant.
			</p>
			<p>
				With a career change and moving to another country, I have moved towards
				shooting architecture and different design photography. I have spent the
				last few years working for a number of clients in this city and across
				another city, town and London.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy the exploration involved in capturing the best angles possible,
				the problem solving for interior compositions and working with light to
				create dynamic and dramatic images.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though I am based in London, I am always open to opportunities
				across the UK, Europe and worldwide.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are an architect, interior designer, developer or work in the
				construction industry, please do get in contact and let me know how I
				can help you create imagery of value for your business.
